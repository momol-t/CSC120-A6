Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
it makes my code easier for me to understand. it breaks things up into smaller chunks that then effect each other in clearer ways. it feels like im putting more effort into defining the relationship and adding structure which helps me personally understand what i am doing more.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I missed class recently due to covid so i spent a lot of time reading the lecture slides and the readme instructions to understand what i am doing and i got a late start on the assignment because i was sick which made everything a little bit harder
